# Calculating potential returns in Python

You are a rich investor and somebody comes to you with an investment opportunity to invest in an advertising
billboard at a busy junction. The offer is as follows :

- You are required to pay $70000 today
- The investment is for 5 years
- The billboard pays an annual rent of $10000
- Current interest rates are 5%
- After five years the billboard needs upgrades, but you don’t want to bother with that.

You are fairly confident that you could sell this investment to someone at $45000, after 5 years and let them
do the upgrades.

Is this a good deal?

Future value (FV) - $45000
Yearly Payment (PMT) - $10000
Period (N) - 5 years
Interest rates (IR) - 5%
Present value (PV) - ? 

But you also receive a call from your brother in law Jim, who wants to start a laundromat business. The cost
of laundromat is $200000, but is short exactly $70000. He is willing to pay you 7.5% for the the loan. 

- You are required to loan $70000 today
- Current interest rates are 7.5%

You reason that Jim is fairly good with money and he maybe able to pay the money back.

Is this a good deal?
