# BASICS OF STOCK DATA

Quantitative Analysts who believe in Trading need access to Stock Price and Volume so that they can compute a combination of Technical Indicators (Eg: SMA, BBP, MACD etc) for strategy. This data is available on many platforms such as IEX, Quandl via REST APIS.

**Pandas** is one of the most popular tools for trading strategy development because Pandas has a wide variety of utilities for data collection, manipulation and analysis, etc. It contains subpackage called **pandas_datareader** which provides a consistent simple API to collect data from these platforms and create a dataframe.
