# BASICS OF STOCK DATA

Quantitative Analysts who believe in Trading need access to Stock Price and Volume so that they can compute a combination of Technical Indicators (Eg: SMA, BBP, MACD etc) for strategy. This data is available on many platforms such as IEX, Quandl via REST APIS.

**Pandas** is one of the most popular tools for trading strategy development because Pandas has a wide variety of utilities for data collection, manipulation and analysis, etc. It contains subpackage called **pandas_datareader** which provides a consistent simple API to collect data from these platforms and create a dataframe.

This dataframe consists of attributes such as Date, Opening Price, Closing Price, High Price, Low Price, Volume of the Stocks and Adjusted Closing Price.

- [**High**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/todayshigh.asp) - over the course of the trading day, what was the highest value for that day?
- [**Low**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/todayslow.asp) - over the course of the trading day, what was the lowest value for that day?
- [**Close**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) - When the trading day was over, what was the final price?
- [**Volume**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) - For that day, how many shares were traded?
- [**Adj Close**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusted_closing_price.asp) - It is considered to be the true price of that stock and is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns.
