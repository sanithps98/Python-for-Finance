# Creating CandleCharts for Stock Analysis

Charts are a technical trader's portal to the markets. With so many advances in analysis platforms, traders are able to view a tremendous assortment of market information. But with so much data available, it's important to create well-designed charts that will enhance the market analysis. 

The faster you can interpret market information, the faster you can react to the changing conditions.

There are **4** main types of charts that are used by investors and traders depending on the information that they are seeking and their individual skill levels. The chart types are: **line chart**, **bar chart**, **candlestick chart** and **point & figure chart**. 

Moving on to the main topic, what is a **CandleStick Chart**?

A candlestick chart is a very common and useful representation of stock prices. By looking into a candlestick chart, we can visually see the open, close, low and high price for any given stock.

The main component of the chart which represents prices looks like a candlestick, with a thick ‘body’ and usually a line extending above and below it, called the **upper shadow** and **lower shadow** respectively.The top of the upper shadow represents the **high price**, while the bottom of the lower shadow shows the **low price**. Patterns are formed both by the real body and the shadows. 

The relationship between the bodies of candlesticks is important to candlestick patterns. Candlestick charts make it easy to spot gaps between bodies.
