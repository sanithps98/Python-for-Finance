# How to calculate stock returns in Python

One of the most important tasks in financial markets is to analyze historical returns on various
investments.

For the Stock Basics you can refer : [https://github.com/sanithps98/Python-for-Finance/tree/master/Stock%20Data%20Basics](https://github.com/sanithps98/Python-for-Finance/tree/master/Stock%20Data%20Basics)

A stock's [**adjusted closing price**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answer/06/adjustedclosingprice.asp) gives you all the information you need to keep an eye on your stock.You can use unadjusted closing prices to calculate returns, but adjusted closing prices save you some time and effort.

The adjusted closing price of a stock takes into account dividend payments, splits and other factor which directly influence overall return. Comparing the adjusted closing prices for a single stock over a specific duration of time will allow you to identify its return.

In today's fast-paced financial environment, adjusted closing prices are an excellent tool for capturing an informative snapshot of the day's activity which can help you refine your strategies over the short term.

We are going to calculate the stock returns using Python and it is explained in detail in the Jupyter Notebook

### **Things to know before we proceed**

- [**pct_change()**](https://www.w3resource.com/pandas/series/series-pct_change.php) : It is used to get percentage change between the current and a prior element.
It computes the percentage change from the immediately previous row by default. This is useful in comparing the percentage of change in a time series of elements.

- [**Mean**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp) : The mean is the mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.

- [**Rolling means (or moving averages)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) : A moving average (MA) is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random short-term price fluctuations.

To use the .rolling() method, you must always use method chaining, first calling .rolling() and then chaining an aggregation method after it. 
For example, with a Series hourly_data, hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean() would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out behind each point.

- [**Cumulative Return**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cumulativereturn.asp): A cumulative return on an investment is the aggregate amount that the investment has gained or lost over time, independent of the period of time involved.

- [**Standard Deviation**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) : Standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean.A volatile stock has a high standard deviation

- [**Variance**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) :In investing, variance is used to compare the relative performance of each asset in a portfolio.

- [**Correlation**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp) : Correlation, in the finance and investment industries, is a statistic that measures the degree to which two securities move in relation to each other. 

- [**Covariance**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covariance.asp) : Covariance measures the directional relationship between the returns on two assets. A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means they move inversely. 

- [**Correlation Coefficient**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) : The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0.
