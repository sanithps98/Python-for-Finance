# How to calculate stock returns in Python

One of the most important tasks in financial markets is to analyze historical returns on various investments.

A stock's adjusted closing price gives you all the information you need to keep an eye on your stock. You can use unadjusted closing prices to calculate returns, but adjusted closing prices save you some time and effort. Adjusted prices are already adjusted for stock dividends, cash dividends and splits, which creates a more accurate return calculation.
