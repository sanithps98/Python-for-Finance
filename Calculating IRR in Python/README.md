# How to calculate IRR in Python

In this Python script, we will be calculating the Internal Rate of Return(IRR)

First of all, What Is [Internal Rate of Return â€“ IRR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp)? 

The internal rate of return (IRR) is a metric used in capital budgeting to estimate the profitability of potential investments. The internal rate of return is a discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero.

Calculation of IRR in Python is easy with the **numpy** module.

### **Why do we need to calculate the IRR or Internal rate of returns?**

Let us suppose a manager has an opportunity to invest in two projects, but can only choose one project. The projects are:

Project 1 requires $800 million in investment today, but it will pay 200,250,300,350,400 million in payments each year for the next 5 years.

Project 2 required $500 million in investment today, but it will pay 150,170,178,250,300 in payments each year for the next 5 years.

How would the manager decide which project to choose? To solve this problem we need to calculate the IRR of the two projects.
